Step 4: Improve the Code (Portfolio-Worthy)
Add these features to make your project stand out:

1. Better Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT (Financial-specific NLP):
bash
Copy
pip install transformers torch
python
Copy
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load FinBERT model (financial sentiment analysis)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')

def analyze_sentiment_finbert(headline):
    inputs = tokenizer(headline, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
    return predictions[0][0].item()  # Probability of "neutral" (adjust based on model docs)
2. Predict Next-Day Price (Machine Learning)
Add this to your main() function:

python
Copy
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Prepare data for prediction (use today's sentiment to predict tomorrow's price)
merged_df['target'] = (merged_df['price_change'].shift(-1) > 0).astype(int)  # 1 if price goes up tomorrow
merged_df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Train a simple model
X = merged_df[['sentiment']]
y = merged_df['target']
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Check accuracy
accuracy = model.score(X, y)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
3. Save Results to CSV
python
Copy
merged_df.to_csv('news_vs_stock.csv', index=False)
Step 5: Organize Your Project
Structure your files like this (use VS Code for this):

Copy
stock-predictor/
├── data/                   # Save CSV files here
├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
│   └── exploration.ipynb
├── scripts/                # Python scripts
│   └── stock_news.py
├── requirements.txt        # List of dependencies
└── README.md               # Explain your project
Step 6: Document for Your Portfolio
GitHub README.md:

Explain what the project does.

Show code snippets and visualizations.

Include setup instructions.

Blog Post (Medium/Dev.to):

Title: "Predicting Stock Prices with News Sentiment: A Python Project"

Discuss challenges (e.g., noisy data, lagged market reactions).

Share key results (e.g., "FinBERT improved sentiment accuracy by 20%").

Debugging Tips
Common Errors:

KeyError: Check if the NewsAPI response structure changed.

RateLimitError: NewsAPI’s free tier has limits; add a time.sleep(1) between requests.

Print Intermediate Results:

python
Copy
print(news_df.head())  # See if data is fetched correctly
